# AWSDailySnapshots
Disclamer: I'm a total rookie, so I just borrowed code and figured out how to slightly enhance it. I have added most of the notes
This code will take a daily snapshot of any EC2 instance with the tag name BackupFrequency and value Daily
Language: Python + aws boto3
this was created borrowing heavily from this post
